# Advanced Git Workshop: A Day of Learning CI/CD

I woke up excited for the advanced Git workshop focused on CI/CD. It was a one-day event, and I was eager to dive in.

Arriving at the venue, I saw eager faces and our instructor, Jan, a seasoned DevOps engineer. He began with a quick Git refresher before moving on to setting up a Jenkins pipeline. Seeing it automate testing and deployment in real-time was thrilling.

The hands-on exercises were challenging but rewarding. Jan was always there to help, ensuring everyone could follow along.

The highlight was the final challenge: setting up a full CI/CD pipeline. With Jan's guidance, I configured each step meticulously. Seeing "Build Successful" gave me a rush of accomplishment.

The workshop ended with a Q&A. Leaving the room, I felt proud and equipped with new skills, ready to apply them to my projects. It was a day well spent.
