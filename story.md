# Advanced Git Workshop: A Day of Learning CI/CD

I woke up excited for the advanced Git workshop focused on CI/CD. It was a one-day event, and I was eager to dive in.

Arriving at the venue, I saw eager faces and our instructor, Jan, a seasoned DevOps engineer. He began with a quick Git refresher before moving on to setting up a Jenkins pipeline. Seeing it automate testing and deployment in real-time was thrilling.
